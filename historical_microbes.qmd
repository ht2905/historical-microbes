# Microbes that Changed History

This section examines the all-encompassing influence of pathogenic microbes on human civilization, focusing on two specific agents that altered demographic, economic, and social structures globally.

## The Black Death and *Yersinia pestis*

The Black Death, a devastating pandemic caused by the bacterium *Y. pestis* that peaked between 1346 and 1353, serves as a primary example of microbial impact on human history. The disease is believed to have traveled along the Silk Road from Central Asia to Europe, facilitated by the expansion of trade routes and the movement of armies [@BlackDeathPlague2025; @spyrouSourceBlackDeath2022]. Upon reaching Europe, the plague caused a demographic collapse of unprecedented scale, killing an estimated $50\%$ of the population in affected regions of Europe and Asia [@BlackDeathEuropean; @aberthBrinkApocalypseConfronting2013].

The massive loss of life triggered profound societal and economic shifts. The sudden scarcity of labor empowered the surviving peasantry, which led to the decline of the feudal system as workers demanded higher wages and better conditions [@DecameronWebPlague; @LaborShortagesAlter]. The psychological trauma of the pandemic also reshaped religious and social attitudes, manifesting in extreme movements such as the flagellants and the persecution of minority groups [@markReligiousResponsesBlack2020; @zentnerBlackDeathIts].

The causative agent of the plague is the bacterium *Yersinia pestis*. The transmission cycle historically involved the black rat (*Rattus rattus*) and the rat flea (*Xenopsylla cheopis*) [@eisenEarlyPhaseTransmissionYersinia2007]. When the flea bites an infected host, the bacteria block the flea's digestive tract, causing it to regurgitate the pathogen into the bloodstream of a new host during subsequent feeding attempts [@hinnebuschComparativeAbilityOropsylla2017]. While bubonic plague was the most common form, the pneumonic form allowed for direct person-to-person transmission—thereby accelerating the spread [@earnAccelerationPlagueOutbreaks2020; @Plague]. Fig. \ref{fig:black-death-transmission} demonstrates in detail how the plague is spread.

    \caption{Mechanisms of Plague (\textit{Y. pestis}) Transmission and Disease Progression. The cycle begins with (1) the Flea Life Cycle: Eggs, laid in moist soil/burrows, hatch into larvae that feed on rodent feces and develop into pupae and adult fleas. Infected adult fleas parasitize rodents. (2) The Enzootic Cycle maintains \textit{Y. pestis} among rodent hosts and reservoirs, primarily vectored by fleas (\textit{X. cheopis}, \textit{X. brasiliensis}, and \textit{S. fonquerniei}). (3, 4) Epizootic Spills occur when fleas infect non-host mammals, which often lack resistance, rapidly succumb to the disease, and spread the plague geographically. (5) Human Zoonotic Transmission: Humans are typically infected via the bite of an infected flea from a rodent or secondary mammal host. (6) Human-to-Human Spread: Bubonic plague may progress to a highly contagious pneumonic plague via lung infection, enabling \textit{Y. pestis} transmission through infectious respiratory droplets generated by coughing.

## Smallpox and Global Eradication

Shifting focus to another microbial agent that fundamentally altered human history: Smallpox. Caused by the *Variola major* virus and carrying a fatality rate $\approx 30\%$, the disease played a decisive role in the colonization of the Americas. Following the arrival of Europeans, smallpox decimated indigenous populations, such as the Aztecs and Incas, who possessed no prior immunity [@pattersonSmallpoxNativeAmerican2002]. This "virgin soil" epidemic killed tens of millions—perhaps up to $95\%$ of the indigenous population of the Americas—far exceeding deaths caused by warfare and facilitating the collapse of indigenous empires [@marrNewHypothesisCause2010; @legnaghidealmeidaMicroscopicSettlerSmallpox2025]. Due to a lack of reliable data, historians continue to debate the true mortality rates and extent of casualties.

The fight against smallpox marked the birth of immunology. In 1796, Edward Jenner observed that milkmaids who contracted cowpox, a mild disease, were immune to smallpox. He tested this hypothesis by inoculating a young boy with material from a cowpox lesion and subsequently exposing him to smallpox; the boy remained healthy [@riedelSmallpoxBiologicalWarfare2005; @barquetSmallpoxTriumphMost1997]. Jenner’s work established the principle of vaccination, a term derived from *vacca* (Latin for cow), replacing the riskier practice of variolatio, an earlier technique that intentionally induced a mild smallpox infection to confer immunity [@vaishaliEdwardJennerPioneer2024].

Smallpox holds the distinction of being the first and only human infectious disease to be eradicated. Following a massive global campaign by the World Health Organization (WHO) involving vaccination, surveillance, and quarantine, the disease was declared eradicated in 1980 [@Smallpox; @simonsenSmallpox2025]. This achievement stands as one of the greatest triumphs of public health and microbiology.

# Famous Microbiologists and Groundbreaking Discoveries

This section highlights the contributions of three pivotal figures whose work transitioned medicine from superstition to the scientific germ theory of disease.

## Louis Pasteur: The Father of Modern Microbiology

### Germ Theory

Louis Pasteur, a French chemist, fundamentally changed the understanding of biology by disproving the theory of spontaneous generation. Through his elegant experiments using swan-necked flasks, he demonstrated that microorganisms in the air, not a "vital force," caused contamination in sterile broth [@LouisPasteurMicrobiology2025]. Fig. \ref{fig:fig-swan-necked} shows the setup of this experiment. Pasteur's work laid the foundation for the germ theory of disease, which establishes that specific invisible microbes are responsible for specific illnesses [@LouisPasteurGerm].

    \label{fig:fig-swan-necked}
\end{figure*}

### Pasteurization
In addition to establishing the germ theory, Pasteur applied his knowledge of fermentation to solve problems in the French wine and silk industries. He discovered that heating liquids to a specific temperature ($60–90^{\circ}\text{C}$) killed the bacteria responsible for spoilage without destroying the product. This process, known as pasteurization, revolutionized food safety and is still widely used today for milk and other beverages [@PasteurizationDefinitionProcess2025].

### Vaccine Development

Pasteur also pioneered the development of laboratory-attenuated vaccines. He created vaccines for chicken cholera and anthrax by using weakened strains of the bacteria [@smithLouisPasteurFather2012]. His most famous medical achievement was the development of the rabies vaccine in 1885, which he successfully used to save the life of Joseph Meister, a boy bitten by a rabid dog [@repiquetMethodePasteurPour1891; @rappuoli1885FirstRabies2014].

## Alexander Fleming: The Serendipitous Discovery

### Discovery of Penicillin

In 1928, Scottish bacteriologist Alexander Fleming made a serendipitous discovery that launched the antibiotic era. Upon returning from a holiday, he noticed that a mold, *Penicillium notatum*, had contaminated a Petri dish of *Staphylococcus* bacteria. Crucially, he observed that the bacteria surrounding the mold had been destroyed [@gaynesDiscoveryPenicillinNew2017].

### Impact on Medicine

Fleming identified the mold's active substance as penicillin. Although mass production was later achieved by Howard Florey and Ernst Chain during World War II, Fleming’s discovery provided the first effective treatment for bacterial infections that had previously been fatal [@DiscoveryAntibiotics; @tanAlexanderFleming188119552015]. Penicillin was hailed as a "miracle drug," saving millions of lives from wound infections and diseases like syphilis and pneumonia, though Fleming himself warned early on about the potential for antibiotic resistance [@SirAlexanderFleming].

## Robert Koch and Koch's Postulates

### Methodological Rigor

Robert Koch, a German physician, is often considered the father of medical bacteriology alongside Pasteur. He introduced rigorous scientific methods to the field, most notably "Koch's Postulates." This set of four criteria is used to establish a causal relationship between a specific microbe and a specific disease: (1) the microbe must be present in every case of the disease; (2) it must be isolated and grown in pure culture; (3) inoculation of the culture into a healthy host must reproduce the disease; and (4) the microbe must be recovered again from the experimentally infected host [@segreWhatDoesIt2013; @walkerKochsPostulatesInfectious2006].

### Key Discoveries

Using these methods, Koch identified the specific causative agents of several deadly diseases, including *Bacillus anthracis* (anthrax), *Vibrio cholerae* (cholera), and *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (tuberculosis) [@kochAetiologieMilzbrandKrankheitBegruendet2010; @UeberAugenblicklichenStand; @gesundheitsamtMittheilungenAusKaiserlichen1884]. His work provided the definitive proof for the germ theory of disease and established the standards for diagnostic microbiology [@tyagiTimelessLegacyRobert2006].
