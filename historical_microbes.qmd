abstract: |
  Microorganisms have repeatedly reshaped human societies, culture, and scientific knowledge in ways that extend well beyond their microscopic scale. This paper synthesizes historical, cultural, and astrobiological literature to argue that microbes function as active agents of change—biological actors whose properties (transmission, immunity, metabolism, and environmental tolerance) reconfigure demographic systems, material practices, and scientific paradigms. Section 1 examines pandemics (notably the Black Death and smallpox) to show how pathogen biology produced lasting political, economic, and social transformations. Section 2 reviews foundational microbiologists (Pasteur, Koch, Fleming) whose experiments and discoveries converted microbes from ambiguous forces into identifiable, governable entities and enabled interventions such as pasteurization, vaccination, and antibiotics. Section 3 explores microbial contributions to art and industry, highlighting bacterial agar art and fungal/yeast-derived pigments as examples of how microbes mediate creative and sustainable material practices. Section 4 extends the analysis to astromicrobiology, summarizing extremophile biology, orbital exposure experiments (e.g., EXPOSE/ADAPT), and implications for panspermia and planetary protection. Across these domains the paper emphasizes two themes: (1) microbial agency as a useful analytical lens for connecting biological mechanisms to historical and cultural outcomes, and (2) the continuing negotiation between human attempts to control microbes and microbial evolutionary responses (e.g., antibiotic resistance; contamination risks). The paper concludes by outlining ethical and research priorities—improved historical–biological integration, sustainable bio-based technologies, and strengthened planetary-protection protocols—to guide future study of microbes as active participants in planetary and human history.

# Introduction

Microbes are among the most abundant and influential life forms on Earth, contributing substantially to planetary biomass and shaping ecosystems at every level despite their microscopic size, a fact that becomes especially clear when viewed through historical, cultural, and planetary perspectives.. Throughout history, microorganisms have reshaped human societies, influenced cultural practices, and catalyzed scientific breakthroughs that redefine modern life. From pandemics that altered civilizations to extremophiles that challenge our understanding of life’s limits, microbes exhibit a level of ubiquity and power that is both surprising and foundational as the following sections illustrate. Microbiology, the scientific discipline devoted to the study of microorganisms, reveals the extraordinary breadth of microbial influence across both natural and human systems. As such, microbes are not simply sources of disease, but powerful drivers of historical change, cultural production, and emerging scientific frontiers such as astrobiology. Their largely unseen impact spans multiple disciplines and eras, highlighting the deep interconnectedness between microbial life and human advancement.

This paper is organized into four principal sections to examine these multidimensional contributions of microorganisms. The first explores microbes that changed history by analyzing the social and medical consequences of pandemics such as smallpox and the Black Death. The second surveys pioneering microbiologists whose discoveries transformed science and medicine, including Pasteur, Koch, and Fleming. The third investigates microbial influence in art and culture, with emphasis on bacterial art and natural dye production. The final section extends the discussion beyond Earth, examining extremophiles, microbial survival under space-like conditions, and their implications for astrobiology.

Rather than treating microbes as passive background conditions to which humans merely respond, this paper argues that microorganisms function as active agents of change—entities whose biological properties constrain, redirect, and at times override human intentions across history, culture, and science. By shaping demographic collapse, enabling new artistic media, and redefining planetary habitability, microbes do not simply influence human systems; they actively participate in them. Viewing microbes as agents rather than environmental noise clarifies why they repeatedly reorganize social structures, cultural meaning, and scientific definitions of life itself.

# Microbes that Changed History

This section examines the far-reaching influence of pathogenic microbes on human civilization, focusing on two specific agents that altered demographic, economic, and social structures globally. Rather than acting as passive causes of disease, these microorganisms functioned as active historical forces, reshaping political systems, economic structures, and patterns of human belief on a global scale.

## The Black Death and *Yersinia pestis*

The Black Death, a devastating pandemic caused by the bacterium *Yersinia pestis* that peaked between 1346 and 1353, serves as a primary example of microbial impact on human history. The disease is believed to have traveled along the Silk Road from Central Asia to Europe, facilitated by the expansion of trade routes and the movement of armies [@BlackDeathPlague2025; @spyrouSourceBlackDeath2022]. Upon reaching Europe, the plague caused a demographic collapse of unprecedented scale, killing an estimated 50% of the population in affected regions of Europe and Asia [@BlackDeathEuropean; @aberthBrinkApocalypseConfronting2013].

The massive loss of life triggered profound societal and economic shifts. The sudden scarcity of labour empowered the surviving peasantry, which led to the decline of the feudal system as workers demanded higher wages and better conditions [@DecameronWebPlague; @LaborShortagesAlter]. The psychological trauma of the pandemic also reshaped religious and social attitudes, manifesting in extreme movements such as the flagellants and the persecution of minority groups [@markReligiousResponsesBlack2020; @zentnerBlackDeathIts]. In this sense, *Yersinia pestis* acted not merely as a pathogen but as a catalyst for systemic change, accelerating social transformations that might otherwise have taken centuries.

The transmission cycle of *Y. pestis* historically involved the black rat (*Rattus rattus*) and the rat flea (*Xenopsylla cheopis*) [@eisenEarlyPhaseTransmissionYersinia2007]. After feeding on an infected host, *Y. pestis* blocks the flea’s gut, causing regurgitation of bacteria into new hosts during later bites [@hinnebuschComparativeAbilityOropsylla2017]. While bubonic plague was the most common form, the pneumonic form allowed direct person-to-person transmission, thereby accelerating spread. Fig. \ref{fig:black-death-transmission} provides a visualized diagram of the transmission pathway. The biological characteristics of *Y. pestis*—its zoonotic reservoir, vector-based transmission, and capacity for airborne spread—directly determined the speed, scale, and severity of its historical impact.

The cycle begins with (1) the Flea Life Cycle: Eggs, laid in moist soil/burrows, hatch into larvae that feed on rodent feces and develop into pupae and adult fleas. Infected adult fleas parasitize rodents. (2) The Enzootic Cycle maintains \textit{Y. pestis} among rodent hosts and reservoirs, primarily vectored by fleas (\textit{X. cheopis}, \textit{X. brasiliensis}, and \textit{S. fonquerniei}). (3, 4) Epizootic Spills occur when fleas infect non-host mammals, which often lack resistance, rapidly succumb to the disease, and spread the plague geographically. (5) Human Zoonotic Transmission: Humans are typically infected via the bite of an infected flea from a rodent or secondary mammal host. (6) Human-to-Human Spread: Bubonic plague may progress to a highly contagious pneumonic plague via lung infection, enabling \textit{Y. pestis} transmission through infectious respiratory droplets generated by coughing.

## Smallpox and Global Eradication

Shifting focus to another microbial agent that fundamentally altered human history: smallpox. Caused by the *Variola major* virus and carrying a fatality rate of ~30%, the disease played a decisive role in the colonization of the Americas. Following the arrival of Europeans, smallpox decimated indigenous populations, such as the Aztecs and Incas, who lacked prior immunity [@pattersonSmallpoxNativeAmerican2002]. This "virgin soil" epidemic killed tens of millions—perhaps up to 95% of the indigenous population of the Americas—far exceeding the deaths caused by warfare and facilitating the collapse of indigenous empires [@marrNewHypothesisCause2010; @legnaghidealmeidaMicroscopicSettlerSmallpox2025].

The fight against smallpox marked the birth of immunology. In 1796, Edward Jenner observed that milkmaids who contracted cowpox (a mild disease) were immune to smallpox. He tested this hypothesis by inoculating a young boy with material from a cowpox lesion and subsequently exposing him to smallpox; the boy remained healthy [@riedelSmallpoxBiologicalWarfare2005; @barquetSmallpoxTriumphMost1997]. Jenner’s work established the principle of vaccination, a term derived from *vacca* (Latin for cow), replacing the riskier practice of variolatio, an earlier technique that intentionally induced a mild smallpox infection to confer immunity [@vaishaliEdwardJennerPioneer2024].

Smallpox holds the distinction of being the first and only human infectious disease to be eradicated. Following a massive global campaign by the World Health Organization (WHO) involving vaccination, surveillance, and quarantine, the disease was declared eradicated in 1980 [@Smallpox; @simonsenSmallpox2025]. As such, the disease marks a turning point in human–microbe relations, where scientific understanding allowed humans strategically to counter microbial influence.

Together, the Black Death and smallpox demonstrate that microbial impact is not limited to mortality statistics but extends to structural reorganization of societies. In both cases, the biological features of the pathogen—mode of transmission, immunity dynamics, and host susceptibility—directly shaped political power, labour systems, and colonial outcomes. These outcomes were not accidental side effects of disease; they were emergent properties of microbial life interacting with human networks. In this sense, microbes acted less like external shocks and more like historical actors whose constraints forced new social equilibria.

# Famous Microbiologists and Groundbreaking Discoveries

This section examines how key microbiologists transformed microbes from invisible forces of fate into identifiable, controllable agents—thereby reshaping history, medicine, and society.

## Louis Pasteur: A Core Founder of Modern Microbiology

### Germ Theory

Louis Pasteur, a French chemist, fundamentally changed biological thinking by experimentally overturning the idea of spontaneous generation. Using swan-necked flasks, he showed that microorganisms from the air—not a mysterious “vital force”—caused contamination of sterile broth (see Fig. \ref{fig:swan-necked}). His work provided crucial support for the germ theory of disease, which holds that specific, often invisible microbes are responsible for specific illnesses [@LouisPasteurMicrobiology2025; @LouisPasteurGerm].

\begin{figure*}[!htb]

    \caption{Pasteur’s swan-necked flask experiment illustrating how airborne microorganisms, rather than a “vital force,” contaminate sterile broth. Reproduced from Shutterstock \cite{PasteurTheorieFuerLebensbeginn}.}
    \label{fig:swan-necked}
\end{figure*}

### Pasteurization
Beyond theory, Pasteur applied his insights to practical problems in the wine and silk industries. He demonstrated that controlled heating of liquids (commonly in the range of $60–90^{\circ}\text{C}$) could kill spoilage organisms without destroying the product. This process—pasteurization—transformed food safety and remains widely used today for milk and other beverages [@PasteurizationDefinitionProcess2025].

### Vaccine Development

Pasteur also pioneered the creation of attenuated vaccines. He developed weakened strains to protect animals from chicken cholera and anthrax, and in 1885 produced a vaccine against rabies that was successfully used to treat Joseph Meister, a boy bitten by a rabid dog [@smithLouisPasteurFather2012; @repiquetMethodePasteurPour1891; @rappuoli1885FirstRabies2014]. These achievements established vaccination as a practicable medical strategy and expanded the possibilities for disease prevention.

## Alexander Fleming: The Serendipitous Discovery

### Discovery of Penicillin

In 1928 Scottish bacteriologist Alexander Fleming made a chance observation that launched the antibiotic era. Returning from a holiday, he noticed that a mold (*Penicillium notatum*) contaminating a Petri dish had produced a clear zone where *Staphylococcus* bacteria failed to grow. From this observation he identified an antibacterial substance produced by the mold [@gaynesDiscoveryPenicillinNew2017].

### Impact on Medicine

Fleming named the active compound penicillin. Although large-scale production was achieved later by Howard Florey and Ernst Chain during World War II, Fleming’s discovery provided the first effective chemical therapy for many previously lethal bacterial infections [@tanAlexanderFleming188119552015]. Penicillin was widely celebrated as a “miracle drug” that saved millions of lives from wound infections and diseases such as pneumonia and syphilis. Importantly, Fleming also cautioned early on about the risk of antibiotic resistance, a concern that remains central to medicine today [@SirAlexanderFleming].

## Robert Koch and Koch's Postulates

### Methodological Rigor

Robert Koch, a German physician, brought methodological rigor to medical microbiology and is often cited alongside Pasteur as a founding figure. He formulated what became known as Koch’s Postulates: (1) the microbe must be present in every case of the disease; (2) it must be isolated and grown in pure culture; (3) inoculation of the culture into a healthy host must reproduce the disease; and (4) the same microbe must be reisolated from the experimentally infected host. These criteria established a clear framework for proving causal relationships between microbes and disease. [@segreWhatDoesIt2013; @walkerKochsPostulatesInfectious2006].

### Key Discoveries

Applying these methods, Koch identified the causative agents of several major diseases, including *Bacillus anthracis* (anthrax), *Vibrio cholerae* (cholera), and *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (tuberculosis) [@kochAetiologieMilzbrandKrankheitBegruendet2010; @UeberAugenblicklichenStand; @gesundheitsamtMittheilungenAusKaiserlichen1884]. His work provided strong, empirically grounded support for germ theory and established standards that shaped diagnostic microbiology for generations. At the same time, the limits of Koch’s Postulates—particularly for viruses, unculturable organisms, and polymicrobial diseases—are now well recognized.

Pasteur, Koch, and Fleming are sometimes presented as isolated geniuses, but their collective legacy is best understood as a transformation of microbes from mysterious forces into governable biological actors. Germ theory reframed disease as a biological interaction amenable to investigation; antibiotics redefined clinical survivability; and laboratory standards stabilized microbial knowledge across institutions. The contemporary challenge of antibiotic resistance underscores that microbes continue to evolve in response to human interventions, reminding us that microbial agency remains an active and ongoing negotiation rather than a problem already solved.

# Microbes in Art and Culture

This section explores the scientific mechanisms underlying microbial involvement in aesthetic and cultural domains, focusing on bacterial pigment production as a medium for art and the role of fungi and yeasts in creating sustainable dyes for textiles.

## Bacterial Art and Bio-Painting

Bacterial art is a form of art resulting from the special combination of microbiology with the power of visual expression by utilizing the Petri dish as a living canvas. This practice is not merely decorative; it is rooted in microbiology. The vivid colors and patterns seen in agar plate artworks arise from biological processes. Many bacteria produce secondary metabolites that are pigmented, and these pigments manifest as visible dyes when the bacteria grow on agar medium. Examples include prodigiosin from *Serratia marcescens* and violacein from *Chromobacterium violaceum*, both vivid secondary metabolites. This makes such bacteria useful as natural “biological dyes” and effective educational tools [@anshiUnveilingIntricaciesMicrobial2024].

A defining feature of bacterial art is its capacity to translate invisible biochemical processes into visually interpretable patterns, making it an effective tool for both scientific inquiry and artistic expression. Pigment synthesis is tightly regulated by microbial metabolism, so colony color and spatial patterns directly reflect environmental factors such as temperature, nutrient composition, oxygen availability, and cell density. For example, prodigiosin production in *Serratia marcescens* varies with culture conditions, meaning that shifts in pigment intensity, colony morphology, or spatial growth patterns serve as intuitive indicators of metabolic state [@suryawanshiStudiesProductionBiological2014]. This ability to convey molecular processes transforms agar art into a functional platform for observing metabolic regulation in real time.

Agar art also inherently showcases microbial diversity. Standard culture techniques (streak plates, spread plates, dilution plating) often reveal multiple pigment-producing bacteria capable of generating carotenoids, phenazines, pyocyanin, and other chromogenic metabolites. When species or strains grow in proximity, their interactions—whether competitive, inhibitory, or cooperative—become visually evident through inhibition zones, pigment suppression, or enhanced coloration. These pigment-mediated interactions have ecological significance because microbial pigments often serve protective or competitive functions (e.g., UV shielding, antioxidant defense, antimicrobial activity). The visual nature of agar art has made it an effective tool for science communication and education: studies show that engaging with microbial art can improve students’ culturing proficiency and their understanding of microbial physiology, colony morphology, and ecological dynamics [@sangwemeMicrobeArtCan2020; @sulaimanIMPACTMICROBIALART2023]. Public exhibitions, such as the microbial displays at ARTIS-Micropia (see Fig. \ref{fig:art-petri}), demonstrate how visually compelling microbial patterns engage broader audiences while conveying core scientific principles.

Beyond its artistic and educational roles, bacterial art has practical applications—most notably, the use of microbial pigments for textile dyeing. Chromogenic bacteria used in agar art (e.g., *Serratia marcescens*, *Chromobacterium violaceum*) have been studied as sustainable dye sources [@venilApplicationVioletPigment2016; @venilExtractionApplicationPigment2021]. *Serratia marcescens* produces prodigiosin, a red prodiginine pigment that has been used successfully in textile coloring [@tuliMicrobialPigmentsNatural2015], while *Chromobacterium violaceum* produces violacein, a violet/blue bisindole pigment [@keerthanaMicrobialPigmentsTypes2025]. Fig. \ref{fig:dye-fabric} shows dyeing results using *C. violaceum*-derived pigment on different fabrics with alum as mordant.

    \label{fig:art-petri}
\end{figure*}

Biopainting extends bacterial art by harnessing biotechnology and synthetic biology to generate colors and images on culture media. Engineering *Escherichia coli* to express a palette of eukaryotic chromoproteins creates vividly colored colonies visible in ambient light, demonstrating that synthetic circuits can be read out as visible color patterns (see Fig. \ref{fig:ecoli-art}). When “painted” onto agar, these patterns directly reflect the activity of specific genes or circuits, allowing researchers to track gene expression, environmental responses, or circuit activation without specialized instrumentation. This approach highlights how biopainting can function as a simple, observable readout for synthetic gene circuits [@liljeruhmEngineeringPaletteEukaryotic2018].

    \label{fig:ecoli-art}
\end{figure*}

## Fungi in Pigmentation and Textiles

Fungi are a valuable source of natural pigments spanning a broad spectrum—yellow, orange, red, purple, blue, brown, and black. Important producers include *Monascus* spp. (red, yellow, orange), *Penicillium* spp. (red, yellow, brown), *Aspergillus* spp. (yellow, brown), *Fusarium* spp. (pink, violet, red), and *Blakeslea trispora* ($\beta$-carotene) [@ratherLichenDerivedNatural2018; @linProductionFungalPigments2022]. For example, *Penicillium brevicompactum* can produce mixtures of yellow, orange, and red pigments, while *Penicillium purpurogenum* produces red pigments that effectively dye wool, silk, polyester, and viscose (see Fig. \ref{fig:pp-pigments}).

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=8cm]{photos/pp_pigments.png}
    \caption{Effect of red pigment produced by \textit{Penicillium purpurogenum} application on different fabrics (wool, silk, polyester, viscose). Reproduced from Elkhateeb W, Elnahas M, Daba G \cite{elkhateebWideRangeApplications2023}.}
    \label{fig:pp-pigments}
\end{figure}

Beyond aesthetic value, these pigments demonstrate microbes’ broader impact on human life: microorganisms are harnessed for food, medicine, creative industries, and industrial applications. Fungi and lichens supplied natural dyes for centuries: species in *Roccella* and *Ochrolechia* were historically used for purples and violets, and various lichens produced dyes widely used in Europe from the 15th to 17th centuries [@ratherLichenDerivedNatural2018]. Contemporary practices have evolved toward industrial fermentation processes that produce bio-dyes for today’s sustainable textile market [@paillie-jimenezNaturalPigmentsMicrobial2020].

Fungal pigments offer a sustainable alternative to many synthetic dyes by reducing environmental pollution and health hazards associated with chemical processing. Many fungal pigments are water-soluble and amenable to fermentation-based scale-up, which can lower solvent use and environmental burden compared with some synthetic dye processes (see Fig. \ref{fig:fungi-scaling}). Tables \ref{tab:industrial-pigments} and \ref{tab:textile-application} summarize fungal pigments produced at industrial scale and their textile applications.

# Bacteria in Space (Astromicrobiology)

Astromicrobiology investigates how microorganisms such as bacteria and archaea survive, adapt, and behave under the extreme physical and chemical conditions found beyond Earth. These organisms—often called extremophiles—are adapted to extremes of temperature, pressure, radiation, salinity, and pH, and inhabit environments such as hydrothermal vents, permafrost, hypersaline lakes, and acidic waters [@yokoyamaWhatAstroMicrobiology2018]. Their survival depends on metabolisms and cellular structures evolved specifically for these extremes. Accurately simulating extraterrestrial ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which is significantly more intense and spans a wider wavelength range than the UV that reaches Earth's surface, is one of the main challenges in astromicrobiology [@horneckSpaceMicrobiology2010]. The solar UV spectrum cannot be completely replicated on Earth even by the most powerful artificial UV generators. Nevertheless, simulation studies remain useful. As an illustration of how extremophiles might exploit the chemical environment of other planets, the acidophilic bacterium *Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans* was found to grow successfully in simulated Martian regolith without added nutrients. In true space conditions, however, the most informative results come from orbital experiments such as the ADAPT study, which exposed genetically UV-resistant *Bacillus subtilis* spores to space radiation in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) [@moellerRolesSmallAcidsoluble2009]. Fig. \ref{fig:sankey-dia} provides an overview of the interconnected medical and microbiological challenges associated with spaceflight and long-term habitation of extraterrestrial environments, illustrating how microbial survival, human health, and planetary conditions are tightly linked. This section therefore argues that microbial survival in space reshapes how we define habitability, contamination, and the origin of life.

## Extremophiles Defined

Extremophiles are organisms—mostly bacteria and archaea—that not only survive but flourish in environments once thought incompatible with life. These environments include extremes of pressure, temperature, pH, radiation, salinity, and nutrient availability [@galloAdvancesExtremophileResearch2024]. Extremophiles provide crucial insight into the boundaries of life on Earth and help astrobiologists evaluate the potential habitability of alien settings.

Extreme settings can be either naturally occurring or man-made; these microbes are just the result of evolution and the best adapted to their surroundings. Terms used to categorize extremophiles include: acidophiles (low pH), alkaliphiles (high pH), anaerobes (oxygen-intolerant), cryophiles/psychrophiles (cold-loving), thermophiles/hyperthermophiles (heat-loving; thermophiles $>\approx40 ^\circ \text{C}$, hyperthermophiles $>\approx 80 ^\circ \text{C}$), piezophiles (high pressure), xerophiles (dry environments), methanogens (methane producers), and toxin-tolerant species. Examples of extreme habitats include deep-sea hydrothermal vents, ice sheets and permafrost, volcanic systems and hot springs, salt pans and hypersaline lakes, and highly acidic or alkaline waters [@merinoLivingExtremesExtremophiles2019; @rekadwadExtremophilesSpeciesThat2023]. The diversity and spatial distribution of these environments are summarized in Fig. \ref{fig:ext-env-earth}.

\begin{figure*}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=17cm]{photos/ext_env_earth.jpg}
    \caption{Representative idealized cross section of Earth’s crust showing the diversity of extreme environments and their approximate location. Reproduced from Merino N, Aronson HS, Bojanova DP, Feyhl-Buska J, Wong ML, Zhang S et al. \cite{merinoLivingExtremesExtremophiles2019}.}
    \label{fig:ext-env-earth}
\end{figure*}

By surviving in such places, extremophiles reveal the true boundaries of Earth-based life and inform strategies for detecting life elsewhere. Extremophilic habitats can be natural (e.g., hydrothermal vents) or anthropogenic (e.g., industrial brines). Regardless of origin, extremophiles represent evolution’s best adaptations to particular conditions [@MicrobiologyDefinitionHistory2025].

## Survival on the International Space Station (ISS)

In the space experiment "Molecular adaption strategies of microorganisms to different space and planetary UV climate conditions" (ADAPT), bacterial endospores of the highly UV-resistant *Bacillus subtilis* strain MW01 were exposed for 559 days on the ESA EXPOSE-E facility mounted outside the ISS. EXPOSE-E allows biological samples to be exposed directly to space vacuum, full-spectrum solar UV radiation (>$110~\text{nm}$), cosmic ionizing radiation, rapid temperature cycling, and simulated Martian surface conditions [@rabbowEXPOSEEESAAstrobiology2012]. The experimental configuration of the facility and the placement of ADAPT samples are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:expose-e}.

One main objective of Mars exploration is to detect organic compounds on the planet's surface. Therefore, understanding the preservation of organic matter under Martian-like conditions is crucial for interpreting future measurements. In ADAPT-related experiments, several organic substances (glycine, serine, phthalic acid—with and without a mineral phase—and mellitic acid) completely degraded after ~1.5 years of exposure to Mars-like UV radiation in space; under Martian surface conditions, their half-lives ranged from roughly 50 to 150 hours. Amino acids and a dipeptide, both in pure form and embedded in meteorite powder, were exposed for 18 months and then analyzed on return to Earth to study photochemical and radiolytic effects [@wassmannSurvivalSporesUVResistant2012]. The results show that molecular structure and UV wavelength influence irradiation resistance, with alanine, valine, glycine, and aminoisobutyric acid among the more resistant compounds and others (e.g., aspartic acid) more labile. Meteorite powder provided a protective effect, highlighting the importance of mineral shielding for prebiotic organics.

### Findings

These experiments attest to remarkable microbial resistance in LEO. *Bacillus subtilis* spores (including the UV-resistant ADAPT strain) survived ~1.5 years of exposure to vacuum, desiccation, and intense solar radiation. Some eukaryotic organisms—such as the green alga *Stichococcus* sp. and the rock-dwelling Antarctic fungus *Cryomyces antarcticus*—also survived, particularly when minimally shielded. This suggests that even thin layers of soil or rock can substantially protect organisms from space stresses, providing experimental support for lithopanspermia. In sharp contrast, many small organic molecules (e.g., glycine, serine) are highly vulnerable to photodegradation under Martian-like UV flux, which implies that absence of organics on a planetary surface might reflect rapid degradation rather than absence of past biology [@wassmannSurvivalSporesUVResistant2012].

### Forward Contamination

EXPOSE-type experiments demonstrate that some terrestrial microbes can withstand space conditions, which raises concerns about forward contamination—the inadvertent transfer of Earth microbes to other celestial bodies via spacecraft. Highly resistant forms, such as *Bacillus* spores or cryptoendolithic fungi, can survive extreme temperatures, radiation, and vacuum, and therefore might contaminate sensitive environments on Mars, Europa, or Enceladus if transported intact [@pacelliResponsesBlackFungus2020]. Such contamination could alter native chemistries or produce false positives for life, compromising astrobiological investigations. Given that very small microbial loads can have measurable effects, missions adopt COSPAR planetary-protection protocols (sterilization, cleanroom assembly, microbial-load reduction) to preserve both scientific integrity and biological isolation of other worlds.

### Panspermia

The demonstrated resistance of some microbes in orbital exposure tests strengthens the physical plausibility of panspermia (particularly lithopanspermia)—the hypothesis that life can be transferred between planets inside ejected rocks [@PanspermiaResearchStarters]. Although EXPOSE experiments lasted only ~1.5 years—far shorter than natural interplanetary transit times—the ability of spores, lichens, and rock-inhabiting fungi to survive vacuum, radiation, and temperature cycling shows that the biological component of interplanetary transfer can be physically possible if sufficient shielding (e.g., rock pores) exists. These experiments do not prove panspermia occurred, but they increase its feasibility by demonstrating that at least some Earth organisms possess the durability required to persist beyond the planet.

# Conclusion

The exploration of microbial life across history, culture, and science—as documented in this paper—illuminates the multifaceted and often underestimated role of microorganisms in shaping human civilization and the cosmos. Microbes are not merely biological entities but historical agents that have driven significant societal shifts: from plagues that altered demographics and political power structures to scientific and cultural innovations that continue to influence human life. Their impact reaches beyond the laboratory—microbes have inspired artists, fueled new forms of creative expression, and challenged our understanding of life through astrobiological studies aboard the ISS. Whether thriving in the scorching heat of hydrothermal vents, frozen within polar ice, or surviving exposure to cosmic radiation, microbes continually expand the boundaries of where life can exist and how it can adapt.

Together, these examples demonstrate that microbes are powerful agents of change—shaping ecosystems, societies, and culture, and redefining the biological limits of habitability on Earth and elsewhere. Far from passive or peripheral, microorganisms drive ecological processes, inspire artistic practice, and help define the criteria we use to judge planetary habitability. In short, microorganisms are active agents woven into biological and human history.
