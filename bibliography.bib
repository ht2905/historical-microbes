  abstract = {Praise for the first edition: "Aberth wears his very considerable and up-to-date scholarship lightly and his study of a series of complex and somber calamites is made remarkably vivid." -- Barrie Dobson, Honorary Professor of History, University of York The later Middle Ages was a period of unparalleled chaos and misery -in the form of war, famine, plague, and death. At times it must have seemed like the end of the world was truly at hand. And yet, as John Aberth reveals in this lively work, late medieval Europeans' cultural assumptions uniquely equipped them to face up postively to the huge problems that they faced. Relying on rich literary, historical and material sources, the book brings this period and its beliefs and attitudes vividly to life. Taking his themes from the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, John Aberth describes how the lives of ordinary people were transformed by a series of crises, including the Great Famine, the Black Death and the Hundred Years War. Yet he also shows how prayers, chronicles, poetry, and especially commemorative art reveal an optimistic people, whose belief in the apocalypse somehow gave them the ability to transcend the woes they faced on this earth. This second edition is brought fully up to date with recent scholarship, and the scope of the book is broadened to include many more examples from mainland Europe. The new edition features fully revised sections on famine, war, and plague, as well as a new epitaph. The book draws some bold new conclusions and raises important questions, which will be fascinating reading for all students and general readers with an interest in medieval history.},

  abstract = {More than 200 years ago, Edward Jenner performed an experiment that laid the foundation for the eradication of smallpox and transformed humankind's fight against disease. Smallpox afflicted humankind as no other disease had don; its persistence and diffusion were without parallel. The disease brought down at least three empires. Generations watched helplessly as their children succumbed to the disease or were disfigured or blinded by it. Attempts were made to contain smallpox by isolating its sufferers and, later, by using variolation with varying degrees of success. However, the definitive solution was not found until Jenner's work was done at the end of the 18th century. Milkmaids who had developed cowpox from contact with cow udders informed Jenner that they were protected from the human form of the disease; he listened to their folk wisdom and raised it to the status of scientific fact. Jenner did not discover vaccination, but he was the first to demonstrate that this technique offered a reliable defense against smallpox. It was also a reliable defense against other illnesses, such as poliomyelitis, measles, and neonatal tetanus, although this was not known in Jenner's lifetime.},

Analysis of these records shows that later epidemics spread significantly faster (``accelerated''). Between the Black Death of 1348 and the later epidemics that culminated with the Great Plague of 1665, we estimate that the epidemic growth rate increased fourfold. Currently available data do not provide enough information to infer the mode of plague transmission in any given epidemic; nevertheless, order-of-magnitude estimates of epidemic parameters suggest that the observed slow growth rates in the 14th century are inconsistent with direct (pneumonic) transmission. We discuss the potential roles of demographic and ecological factors, such as climate change or human or rat population density, in driving the observed acceleration.},

  abstract = {For almost a century, the oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis (Rothschild) (Siphonaptera: Pulicidae), was thought to be the most efficient vector of the plague bacterium Yersinia pestis (Yersin). Approximately 2 wk after consuming an infectious bloodmeal, a blockage often forms in the flea's proventriculus, which forces the flea to increase its biting frequency and consequently increases the likelihood of transmission. However, if fleas remain blocked and continue to feed, they usually die within 5 d of blocking, resulting in a short infectious window. Despite observations of X. cheopis transmitting Y. pestis shortly after pathogen acquisition, early-phase transmission (e.g., transmission 1--4 d postinfection [p.i.]) by unblocked fleas was viewed as anomalous and thought to occur only by mass action. We used an artificial feeding system to infect colony-reared X. cheopis with a fully virulent strain of Y. pestis, and we evaluated transmission efficiency 1--4 d p.i. We demonstrate 1) that a single infected and unblocked X. cheopis can infect a susceptible host as early as 1 d p.i., 2) the number of fleas per host required for unblocked fleas to drive a plague epizootic by early-phase transmission is within the flea infestation range observed in nature, and 3) early-phase transmission by unblocked fleas in the current study was at least as efficient as transmission by blocked fleas in a previously published study using the same colony of fleas and same bacterial strain. Furthermore, transmission efficiency seemed to remain constant until block formation, resulting in an infectious period considerably longer than previously thought.},

However, using these synthetic pigments causes the release of toxic and hazardous substances into the environment. It is a difficult task to find new pigments made from natural materials, yet doing so opens up safer textile coloring methods. A lot of attention has been paid to microbial pigments lately, particularly fungal pigments because of how safe and inexpensive they are. The sustainable manufacture and biodegradable properties of fungi-derived pigments are further benefits of their use. Fungal pigments have the potential to be used in a variety of applications, including textile colorants. A potential remedy for the hazardous side effects of synthetic pigments will be the industrial application of novel biotechnological techniques for the synthesis of fungal pigmentation. Carotenoids, flavins, indigo, melanins, monastics, phenazines, quinones, and violacein are some of the most promising fungal pigments. The numerous fungal pigments and how they are used to dye textile fibers are covered in this chapter. This chapter also emphasizes how fungal pigments will likely be used in a variety of biotechnological applications in the future.},

Through the `universal language of art', many social and preconceived ideas---including abstract scientific concepts---can be challenged and brought to the public attention in a unique way.

Unprecedented United States/Great Britain cooperation to produce penicillin was incredibly successful by 1943. This success overshadowed efforts to produce penicillin during World War II in Europe, particularly in the Netherlands. Information about these efforts, available only in the last 10--15 years, provides new insights into the story of the first antibiotic. Researchers in the Netherlands produced penicillin using their own production methods and marketed it in 1946, which eventually increased the penicillin supply and decreased the price.

Biodegradability and life-cycle-assessment are discussed in this chapter since they are important factors to evaluate the environmental impact of any substance. The second chapter discusses the potential for bacterial pigments to functionalize textile materials with new therapeutic properties, including antifungal and anti-inflammatory effects. Additionally, some bacterial pigments can be used as semiconductors for electronics. The third chapter outlines the challenges of using natural pigments in textile production and suggests techniques to improve colourfastness. The chapter also highlights the successful uses of pigments such as anthraquinone, carotenoid, violacein, melanin, and prodiginine in textile colouring.

  abstract = {Background Transmission of Yersinia pestis by flea bite can occur by two mechanisms. After taking a blood meal from a bacteremic mammal, fleas have the potential to transmit the very next time they feed. This early-phase transmission resembles mechanical transmission in some respects, but the mechanism is unknown. Thereafter, transmission occurs after Yersinia pestis forms a biofilm in the proventricular valve in the flea foregut. The biofilm can impede and sometimes completely block the ingestion of blood, resulting in regurgitative transmission of bacteria into the bite site. In this study, we compared the relative efficiency of the two modes of transmission for Xenopsylla cheopis, a flea known to become completely blocked at a high rate, and Oropsylla montana, a flea that has been considered to rarely develop proventricular blockage. Methodology/Principal findings Fleas that took an infectious blood meal containing Y. pestis were maintained and monitored for four weeks for infection and proventricular blockage. The number of Y. pestis transmitted by groups of fleas by the two modes of transmission was also determined. O. montana readily developed complete proventricular blockage, and large numbers of Y. pestis were transmitted by that mechanism both by it and by X. cheopis, a flea known to block at a high rate. In contrast, few bacteria were transmitted in the early phase by either species. Conclusions A model system incorporating standardized experimental conditions and viability controls was developed to more reliably compare the infection, proventricular blockage and transmission dynamics of different flea vectors, and was used to resolve a long-standing uncertainty concerning the vector competence of O. montana. Both X. cheopis and O. montana are fully capable of transmitting Y. pestis by the proventricular biofilm-dependent mechanism.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY The responses of microorganisms (viruses, bacterial cells, bacterial and fungal spores, and lichens) to selected factors of space (microgravity, galactic cosmic radiation, solar UV radiation, and space vacuum) were determined in space and laboratory simulation experiments. In general, microorganisms tend to thrive in the space flight environment in terms of enhanced growth parameters and a demonstrated ability to proliferate in the presence of normally inhibitory levels of antibiotics. The mechanisms responsible for the observed biological responses, however, are not yet fully understood. A hypothesized interaction of microgravity with radiation-induced DNA repair processes was experimentally refuted. The survival of microorganisms in outer space was investigated to tackle questions on the upper boundary of the biosphere and on the likelihood of interplanetary transport of microorganisms. It was found that extraterrestrial solar UV radiation was the most deleterious factor of space. Among all organisms tested, only lichens (Rhizocarpon geographicum and Xanthoria elegans) maintained full viability after 2 weeks in outer space, whereas all other test systems were inactivated by orders of magnitude. Using optical filters and spores of Bacillus subtilis as a biological UV dosimeter, it was found that the current ozone layer reduces the biological effectiveness of solar UV by 3 orders of magnitude. If shielded against solar UV, spores of B. subtilis were capable of surviving in space for up to 6 years, especially if embedded in clay or meteorite powder (artificial meteorites). The data support the likelihood of interplanetary transfer of microorganisms within meteorites, the so-called lithopanspermia hypothesis.},

The demands for natural alternatives, which involve natural colorants and natural biological processes for their production, have been growing rapidly in recent decades. Fungi contain some of the most prolific pigment producers, and they excel in bioavailability, yield, cost-effectiveness, and ease of large-scale cell culture as well as downstream processing. In contrast, pigments from plants are often limited by seasonal and geographic factors. Here, we delineate the taxonomy of pigmented fungi and fungal pigments, with a focus on the biosynthesis of four major categories of pigments: carotenoids, melanins, polyketides, and azaphilones. The molecular mechanisms and metabolic bases governing fungal pigment biosynthesis are discussed. Furthermore, we summarize the environmental factors that are known to impact the synthesis of different fungal pigments. Most of the environmental factors that enhance fungal pigment production are related to stresses. Finally, we highlight the challenges facing fungal pigment utilization and future trends of fungal pigment development. This integrated review will facilitate further exploitations of pigmented fungi and fungal pigments for broad applications.},

We suggest an additional candidate: leptospirosis complicated by Weil syndrome. Rodent reservoirs from European ships infected indigenous reservoirs and contaminated land and fresh water. Local ecology and high-risk quotidian practices of the native population favored exposure and were not shared by Europeans. Reduction of the population may have been incremental, episodic, and continuous; local customs continuously exposed this population to hyperendemic leptospiral infection over months or years, and only a fraction survived. Previous proposals do not adequately account for signature signs (epistaxis, jaundice) and do not consider customs that may have been instrumental to the near annihilation of Native Americans, which facilitated successful colonization of the Massachusetts Bay area.},

It examines the current evidence regarding the risk of infection during spaceflight via host susceptibility, alterations to the host's microbiome as well as exposure to other crew members and spacecraft's microbiomes. It also considers the relevance of the hygiene hypothesis in this regard. It then reviews the current evidence related to infection risk associated with microbial adaptability in spaceflight conditions. There is a particular focus on the International Space Station (ISS), as one of the only two ~crewed objects in low Earth orbit. It discusses the effects of spaceflight related stressors on viruses and the infection risks associated with latent viral reactivation and increased viral shedding during spaceflight. It then examines the effects of the same stressors on bacteria, particularly in relation to changes in virulence and drug resistance. It also considers our current understanding of fungal adaptability in spaceflight. The global public health and environmental risks associated with a possible re-introduction to Earth of invasive species are also briefly discussed. Finally, this review examines the largely unknown microbiology and infection implications of celestial body habitation with an emphasis placed on Mars. Overall, this review summarises much of our current understanding of medical astro-microbiology and identifies significant knowledge gaps.},

In this study, SASP-defective mutants of B. subtilis and spores deficient in dacB, a mutation leading to an increased core water content, were used to study the relative contributions of SASP and increased core water content to spore resistance to germicidal 254-nm and simulated environmental UV exposure (280 to 400 nm, 290 to 400 nm, and 320 to 400 nm). Spores of strains carrying mutations in sspA, sspB, and both sspA and sspB (lacking the major SASP-alpha and/or SASP-beta) were significantly more sensitive to 254-nm and all polychromatic UV exposures, whereas the UV resistance of spores of the sspE strain (lacking SASP-gamma) was essentially identical to that of the wild type.

Microbial pigments represent an eco-friendly alternative as they can be produced in large amounts through biotechnological processes and do not present environmental risks, as they are easily decomposable. Moreover, some of these metabolites are recognized for their biological activities, which qualify them for potential uses as food colorants and nutraceuticals, protecting against degenerative diseases related with oxidative stress. Because of their genetic simplicity as compared with plants, microorganisms may be a better source to understand biosynthetic mechanisms and to be engineered for producing high pigment yields. Despite the origin of the pigmented microorganism, it seems very important to develop protocols using organic industrial residues and agricultural byproducts as substrates for pigment production and find novel green strategies for rapid pigment extraction. This review looks for the most recent studies that describe microbial pigments from microalgae, fungi, and bacteria. In particular, the underexploited tools of omics science such as proteomics and metabolomics are addressed. The use of techniques involving mass spectrometry, allows to identify different protein and metabolite profiles that may be associated with a variety of biotechnologically-relevant pathways of pigment synthesis.},

  abstract = {The fruiting body of a cup fungus was collected from a compost pit containing fresh cow dung amended with biodynamic herbal preparations. The fungus was identified as Sclerotinia sp. by following standard procedures. The mycelial growth of Sclerotinia sp. on cow pat pit manure was monitored for 90 days and on day 5 pin head primordia were observed and matured into individual fruiting bodies (0.5 cm diameter each, 1 gram fresh weight) on day 20. The fruiting body started yielding dark green spores and the spore deposits were seen on the top surface of the fruiting body. The spores are liberated from the fruiting bodies when they receive an external stimulus. The Sclerotinia sp. spore was elliptical in shape and was 2 \textmu m in size when examined under phase contrast microscope at 40x. The dark green spore of Sclerotinia sp. excretes a pinkish red pigment in distilled water (pH 6.5). Spectrophotometer scanning (200---800 nm) of the pigment showed three peaks: 507 nm (optical density (O.D.) 0.554), 525 nm (O.D. 0.629), and 545 nm (O.D. 0.567). The pigment had high protein content (0.332 mg/ml) but no deductible amount of carbohydrates or lipids. Stability of the pigment was tested at various temperatures (40---100{$^\circ$}C) and no change in its original color was observed under UV---visible spectral scan analysis. Pigment from Sclerotinia sp. changed its original pinkish red color at various pH values (pH 2.0, 3.0, and 14.0). The antibacterial activity of this pigment extract was tested on seven different bacteria of which a zone of inhibition was observed for E. coli. The pigment from Sclerotinia sp. applied on cotton yarns pretreated with different mordants gave different color shades, which were confirmed using the standard color code index.},

However, Pasteur was working at the dawn of the appreciation of the microbial world, at a time when the notion of such a thing as an immune system did not exist, certainly not as we know it today, more than 130\,years later. Accordingly, why was Pasteur such a genius as to discern how the immune system functions to protect us against invasion by the microbial world when no one had even made the distinction between fungi, bacteria, or viruses, and no one had formulated any theories of immunity. A careful reading of Pasteur's presentations to the Academy of Sciences reveals that Pasteur was entirely mistaken as to how immunity occurs, in that he reasoned, as a good microbiologist would, that appropriately attenuated microbes would deplete the host of vital trace nutrients absolutely required for their viability and growth, and not an active response on the part of the host. Even so, he focused attention on immunity, preparing the ground for others who followed. This review chronicles Pasteur's remarkable metamorphosis from organic chemist to microbiologist to immunologist, and from basic science to medicine.},

Until now, the most debated archaeological evidence potentially associated with the pandemic's initiation derives from cemeteries located near Lake Issyk-Kul of modern-day Kyrgyzstan,--. These sites are thought to have housed victims of a fourteenth-century epidemic as tombstone inscriptions directly dated to 1338--1339 state `pestilence' as the cause of death for the buried individuals. Here we report ancient DNA data from seven individuals exhumed from two of these cemeteries, Kara-Djigach and Burana. Our synthesis of archaeological, historical and ancient genomic data shows a clear involvement of the plague bacterium Yersinia pestis in this epidemic event. Two reconstructed ancient Y. pestis genomes represent a single strain and are identified as the most recent common ancestor of a major diversification commonly associated with the pandemic's emergence, here dated to the first half of the fourteenth century. Comparisons with present-day diversity from Y. pestis reservoirs in the extended Tian Shan region support a local emergence of the recovered ancient strain. Through multiple lines of evidence, our data support an early fourteenth-century source of the second plague pandemic in central Eurasia.},

Born in 1749 in Berkeley, Gloucestershire, Jenner received early medical training under the guidance of John Hunter, a distinguished British surgeon. Although variolation offered some immunity to smallpox, it was a hazardous procedure that could result in severe illness or even death. It was within the context of limited and hazardous medical practices that Jenner made his revolutionary observation that milkmaids who had contracted cowpox, a relatively mild illness, appeared to be immune to smallpox. This local folklore piqued Jenner's interest, leading him to investigate the potential of cowpox as a safer alternative to variolation. His work paved the way for the development of vaccines for other infectious diseases, transforming public health and establishing a foundation for modern immunology. The smallpox vaccine became a crucial element of public health initiatives, ultimately leading to the global eradication of the disease by the late 20th century. Jenner's contributions have saved countless lives and represent a testament to the enduring influence of his work on global health. His pioneering efforts laid the groundwork for vaccines that protect us today, solidifying his place as one of the most influential figures in medical history.},

Such explorations have created a fervent interest among textile stakeholders to undertake the dyeing of textile fabrics, especially with fungal pigments. The biodegradable and sustainable production of natural colorants from fungal sources stand as being comparatively advantageous to synthetic dyes. The prospective scope of fungal pigments has emerged in the opening of many new avenues in textile colorants for wide ranging applications. Applying the biotechnological processes, fungal pigments like carotenoids, melanins, flavins, phenazines, quinones, monascins, violacein, indigo, etc. could be extracted on an industrial scale. This review appraises the studies and applications of various fungal pigments in dyeing textile fabrics and is furthermore shedding light on the importance of toxicity testing, genetic manipulations of fungal pigments, and their future perspectives under biotechnological approaches.},

Because the rules were developed for living agents---particularly bacteria---their applicability to inanimate pathogens such as viruses and infectious proteins has been problematic. The unorthodox mechanism by which prion diseases are transmitted, involving specific physicochemical characteristics of the protein as well as susceptibility traits of the host, has made these disorders refractory to analysis within the context of the original Koch's postulates. In addition, evidence is accumulating that other proteopathies, such as AA amyloidosis, apolipoprotein AII amyloidosis, and cerebral A{$\beta$} amyloidosis, can be induced in vulnerable recipients by cognate proteinaceous agents. In light of the salient differences in the mode of disease-transmission by microbes and proteins, we propose modifications of Koch's postulates that will specifically accommodate presumed infectious proteins.},

  abstract = {In the space experiment ``Molecular adaptation strategies of microorganisms to different space and planetary UV climate conditions'' (ADAPT), bacterial endospores of the highly UV-resistant Bacillus subtilis strain MW01 were exposed to low-Earth orbit (LEO) and simulated martian surface conditions for 559 days on board the European Space Agency's exposure facility EXPOSE-E, mounted outside the International Space Station. The survival of B. subtilis MW01 spores from both assays (LEO and simulated martian conditions) was determined by a colony-formation assay after retrieval. It was clearly shown that solar extraterrestrial UV radiation ({$\lambda\geq$}110\,nm) as well as the martian UV spectrum ({$\lambda\geq$}200\,nm) was the most deleterious factor applied; in some samples only a few spore survivors were recovered from B. subtilis MW01 spores exposed in monolayers. However, if shielded from solar irradiation, about 8\% of MW01 spores survived in LEO conditions, and 100\% survived in simulated martian conditions, compared to the laboratory controls. The results demonstrate the effect of shielding against the high inactivation potential of extraterrestrial solar UV radiation, which limits the chances of survival of even the highly UV-resistant strain of B. subtilis MW01 in the harsh environments of outer space and the martian surface.
